# Backtracking 

**Backtracking is an improvement of the brute force approach.**
*It systematically searches for a solution to a problem among all available options. In backtracking, we start with one possible option out of many available option and try to solve the problem if we are to solve the problem with the selected move then we will print the solution else we will backtrack and select some other option and try to solve it. If none if the options work out we will claim that there is no solution for the problem.*

**Backtracking is a form of recursion. The usual scenario is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a new set of options; just what set of options; just what set of options you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you reach a final state.**
