# Introduction of Linked Lists :

**A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. A linked list has the following properties.**

* Successive elements are connected by pointers.
* Last element is always pointed to null.
* Can grow and shrink in size as the element numbers modify.
* Can be made as long as required {until the system memory exhaust}. 
* Doesn't waste memory space {but takes some extra memory for connected pointers}. It allocates as list grows.
