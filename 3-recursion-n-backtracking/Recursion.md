# Recursion and Backtracking

### What is Recursion ?

**Any function which calls itself is called recursion. A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. This is called the recursion step. The recursion step can result in many more such recursive calls.**

*`Note :`* **It is important to ensure that the recursion `terminates`.**

### Why Recursion ?

**Recursion is a useful technique borrowed from mathematics. Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to write than iterative code.** <br>
*Generally, loops are turned into recursive functions when they are compiled or interpreted.* <br>
**Recursion is most useful for tasks that can be defined in terms of similar subtasks. `For example :` sort, search and traversal problems often have simple recursive solutions.**
